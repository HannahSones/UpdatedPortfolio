## About the project
Further building on my exisitng HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills, I have built a mobile-firt, responsive portfolio to showcase my expierence. The site includes a brief profile of myself, along with six examples of previous work including the most recent group project. It also highlights some of the key skills I've learnt during the first third of the University of Birmingham's coding camp and includes an up-to-date CV.

To ensure mobile responsiveness, I used Bootstrap and it's grid system to design and customize the site.

## Further Development
* When I first built the site, I had said that I wanted to explore the use of animations when I had more time. I have since been able to research this and using the AOS animation library, I have been able to create animations on scroll which bring the site to life and make it more engaging for users.
